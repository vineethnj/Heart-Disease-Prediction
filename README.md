Heart Disease Prediction
Developed a comprehensive machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients, leveraging a diverse range of classification and regression algorithms.
Performed extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection to identify the most accurate and robust algorithms for this critical healthcare application.
Evaluated and compared the performance of multiple algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and support vector machines, among others.
